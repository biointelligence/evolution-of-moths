# :butterfly: Evolution of Moths

Evolution of moths establishes an intimate relationship between human ability to solve problems and natural processes. It is invaluable to observe how nature is able to find the best way to be able to continue its ecosystem. 

Evolution of moths presents a strategy based on evolutionary biology with the purpose of offering solutions to real problems, whether scientific, technological or business. 

Operating on the logic of genetic algorithms, it is possible to validate by observing in a simplistic model the adaptation process of the moths during the industrial revolution in England.

Evolution of moths wants to influence developers to consider natural selection techniques for problem solving, allowing solutions to adapt to the environment in which they coexist.
